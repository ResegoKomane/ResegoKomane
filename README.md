I'm a BCom Honours Investment Management student at the University of Pretoria, passionate about quantitative finance and the application of technology in financial markets. My goal is to leverage data-driven insights to solve complex investment challenges.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

A highly resilient and ambitious student with a proven ability to overcome significant adversity and excel. After navigating a serious injury in 2023, I orchestrated a significant academic and personal comeback, demonstrating exceptional determination, focus, and maturity. This experience, combined with a strong academic foundation in financial analysis and four years in client-facing roles, has equipped me with a unique combination of technical skill, mental fortitude, and interpersonal excellence.

* 🌱 I’m currently deepening my understanding of **Python for financial data analysis** and exploring **systematic trading strategies**.
* 🤔 I’m looking for opportunities to apply my analytical skills in an entry-level or graduate role in **Investment Management, Asset Management, or Quantitative Finance**.
* 💬 Ask me about **equity valuation, portfolio theory, or my journey into tech**.
